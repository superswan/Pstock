# Pstock
A Python watchlist and portfolio manager for the equities market

## Configuration
An API token from iexcloud is required, it can be acquired freely via https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register
I chose not to include my own API key in this project for the time being. You can set "API_TOKEN" field in config.ini

## TODO
- TUI
- GUI
- Change config to JSON format
- Portfolio Management
- Symbol Search
- Make API calls more efficient
- Access Financials
